### Sweetening React Native Development with Ignite - Chain React 2024

July 2024

Starting apps from scratch can feel a little sour, but with 9 years of React Native experience, and dozens of greenfield apps taken from zero to production, Infinite Red has perfected the recipe for joy and bottled it up with our open source React Native starter kit: Ignite. In this talk, you’ll learn about all of the goodies included with Ignite, how Infinite Red has honed the Ignite stack through teamwork and experience, and how you can be a part of the magic too.

### Web Wednesday with Chris Harrison

We tend to think about web apps as being completely separate from native iOS and Android apps. But often we end up writing very similar business logic and even visual content on each platform — reinventing the wheel each time. This leads to duplicated effort and can result in out-of-sync app features. With React Native and React Native Web, we now have a framework to write UI code and business logic in a common language (JavaScript) and then deploy to all platforms. In this episode, we’ll demonstrate how to build a single codebase which will power web, iOS and Android.
